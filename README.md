## Machine Learning!


- Clone this repository!
- We are following [Hands on Maching Learning with SciKit Learn and TensorFlow](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Hands-Machine-Learning-Scikit-Learn-TensorFlow/dp/1491962291),
  please read! 
- Each chapter will have an associated notebook.
- Datasets are not included here but a download link should be provided in the notebook, or here.

### Notebook

A notebook can bet started by navigating to this project and running `jupyter notebook`.


### Chapter 1 - An introduction

Chapter one will be an introduction to the way we are working, a broad look at 
the topic of Machine Learning and hopefully a good place to start. While there
won't be any code, the notebook will be at `notebooks/introduction.ipynb`.

### Chapter 2 - An end to end ML problem.

In this chapter we will walk through a small example, becoming
more familiar with some steps in tackling a new problem.

The notebook is `notebooks/pokemon.pynb`. The dataset can be found
[here](https://www.kaggle.com/abcsds/pokemon).


### Requirements

Details of setting up the environment can be found in _the book_ (pg. 40).
We will be using the following python libraries:

```
jupyter, matplotlib, numpy, pandas, scipy, sklearn
```
